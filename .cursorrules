  # Cursor Action Rules

## 1. Context & Scope Management
* **Minimal File Access:** Read only the files strictly necessary for the current task.
* **Targeted Modification:** Modify only the files directly related to the current objective.
* **No Unrelated Code:** Never generate or modify code that is not explicitly requested or essential for the task.

## 2. Code Integrity & Minimal Impact
* **Atomic Changes:** Apply changes within the smallest possible scope. Avoid rewriting entire functions if only a single line needs a fix.
* **Side-effect Prevention:** Do not refactor or change unrelated logic unless it is critical for the current fix.
* **Excel Files Read-Only:** Excel files (`.xlsx`, `.xls`) are read-only. Never modify, write, or overwrite Excel files. Only read data from them when necessary for the task.

## 3. Communication & Rule Compliance
* **Consent for Rule Changes:** Ask for explicit user permission before modifying or adding any rules in `.cursorrules`.
* **Reasoning:** Briefly explain which files are being modified and why, especially if the change spans multiple files.
